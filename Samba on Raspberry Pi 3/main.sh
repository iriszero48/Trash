# A very crude script to setup samba inspired by MrEngmans Realtek RTL8188CUS script
#  V1.1 - added in apt-get update
#  V1.2 - public share (e.g / files) can now be edited using remote pi user
#  V1.3 - server name now automatically taken from /etc/hostname 20Jan16
#  V1.4 - root files can now be edited again using remote pi user 16Feb16
#  V1.5 - updated as errors with lastest Raspbain 15Map16
#  V1.5a 9Jul16 - add force-yes to apt-get update
